# Changelog

All notable changes to the **`dc` client repo** (formerly `dc-official` /
`dc-py`) are listed here. The version
numbers below track `DC_API_VERSION` in [`py/dc.py`](py/dc.py), which is
deliberately aligned with the DC Member API server version it was last
verified against. Patch bumps from the server are silent; minor or major
bumps surface a one-shot stderr warning when this client falls behind.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for
the public Python API surface (`dc.DC`, `dc.DCError`, `dc.Result`,
`dc.Runtime`).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.4] – 2026-06-16

### Added

- **MCP tool annotations** — every tool now advertises `readOnlyHint` /
  `destructiveHint` / `openWorldHint`, so clients can auto-approve reads and
  flag writes. The read/write split is derived from each command's actual HTTP
  verb and guarded by a test that re-derives it from source (no silent drift).
  Write tools also carry a "⚠️ Write operation" note in their description,
  mirroring the hosted MCP server.
- **Structured tool output** — object results (the list envelope
  `{items, count, cursor, has_more}` and single records) are also returned as
  MCP `structuredContent`, so structure-aware clients don't have to re-parse
  the text. No `outputSchema` is declared (it would strictly validate every
  response shape); lists/scalars remain text-only.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (MCP interface) — tool names and fields are now snake_case.**
  MCP tool names switched from kebab-case to snake_case
  (`mcp__dc__trip-create` → `mcp__dc__trip_create`), and tool argument fields
  likewise (`event-id` → `event_id`, `start-date` → `start_date`). This aligns
  the agent-facing MCP surface with the snake_case Python library
  (`dc.trip_create()`) and the prevailing MCP tool-naming convention. The
  **CLI is unchanged** (`dc trip-create`, `--start-date`). Wildcard allow-rules
  like `mcp__dc__*` are unaffected; any config pinning a specific kebab tool
  name must update it. `_call_tool` still accepts the legacy kebab form as a
  transitional fallback.

### Docs / packaging

- Document the hosted MCP (`https://api.dynamitecircle.com/mcp`) and an
  auto-updating `uvx` PyPI config; fix the `.venv/bin/python3` configs to bare
  `python3`; unify `py/SKILL.md` (local client + hosted MCP) and add
  `DC/SKILL.md`; add `tests/test_version_sync.py` guarding manifest/config
  drift from `DC_API_VERSION`.
- **One-click install** — "Add to Cursor" and "Install in VS Code" badges for
  the hosted MCP, a native VS Code section (`.vscode/mcp.json` + `code --add-mcp`),
  and a `workflows`-first note for the ~80-tool surface.
- **`.mcpb` bundle** — the release workflow now builds a `dc.mcpb` (one-click
  Claude Desktop install) via `mcpb pack` and attaches it to the GitHub release;
  `.mcpbignore` keeps the bundle lean.
- **Official MCP Registry** — add `server.json` (`io.github.dynamitecircle/dc`,
  listing the hosted streamable-HTTP endpoint) and a separate, isolated
  `publish-mcp.yml` workflow that publishes it via GitHub OIDC on `v*` tags.
  The registry feeds VS Code, Smithery, PulseMCP, and others. `server.json`
  version is guarded by `tests/test_version_sync.py`.

## [2.0.1] – 2026-06-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING — formal field names, no aliases, no back-compat.** Renamed to
  match the Member API v2 rename:
  - Profile: `bizDesc`→`businessDescription`, `bizName`→`businessName`,
    `bizWeb`→`businessWebsite`, `bizIndustry`→`businessIndustry`,
    `bizRevenue`→`annualRevenue` (+`annualRevenueIsPrivate`), `bizTeam`→`teamSize`
    (+`teamSizeIsPrivate`), `bizOther`→`otherBusinesses`,
    `bizPast`→`previousBusinesses`, `yearsInBiz`→`yearsInBusiness`,
    `ama`→`askMeAnythingTopics`, `connect`→`peopleOfInterest`
    (+`peopleOfInterestIsPrivate`), `locs`→`relevantLocations`,
    `goal`→`currentChallenge`, `whatsapp`→`whatsApp`.
  - Matchmaker: `industry`→`businessIndustry`, `minRevenue`→`minAnnualRevenue`,
    `noRerank`→`skipReranking`.
  - Event free-slots: `minDurationMins`→`minDurationMinutes`,
    `withinDayDate`→`eventDayDate` (response `durationMins`→`durationMinutes`).
- **Removed the legacy field aliases** (`businessDescription`→`bizDesc`, etc.) —
  the server now accepts the formal names natively.

### Added

- Property **discoverability**: an unknown field on any endpoint now returns a
  fuzzy `Unknown field 'X' — did you mean 'Y'?` error with the valid-field list,
  instead of a bare rejection.

## [1.23.3] – 2026-06-13

### Fixed

- **Help text wrongly claimed several event commands require a ticket.**
  Mirroring the server `1.23.3` ticket-gating relax, `event-sponsors`,
  `event-agendas`, and the `--user-id` form of `event-agenda` (viewing another
  attendee's agenda) are now open to any DCer — their help + argument
  descriptions no longer say "requires a ticket". Your OWN `event-agenda`,
  `event-free-slots`, `session-bookmark`, and `meetup-rsvp` stay ticket-gated
  (unchanged). No client behavior change — the server enforces access; this only
  corrects the advertised help so agents don't pre-filter on a ticket they don't
  need.

### Note

Version jumps `1.22.6 → 1.23.3` to realign with the live Member API version (the
`1.23.0`–`1.23.2` server releases — service-layer refactor + in-process MCP
cutover — were server-only with no client surface change, so no client release).

## [1.22.6] – 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- **`profile-update` advertised field names that 400.** The MCP/CLI schema
  documented `businessDescription`, `businessUrl`, and `industry` — none of
  which exist in the server's strict `/profile` schema, so they failed with a
  400. Reworked the blind passthrough into an explicit, validated field map
  covering all 30 real API fields (correct names, boolean coercion for the
  `*IsPrivate` flags); the three legacy names are now accepted as aliases.
  Unknown fields are rejected client-side with the valid list.
- **`trip-create` / `trip-update` silently dropped top-level `--note`.** The
  server accepts a trip caption (`note`) on create + update, but the client
  never sent it through the parser, wrapper, MCP schema, or request body.
  Now fully wired. (HS 3339048660)
- **`calendar-update` forwarded unknown toggles to the server.** Now validated
  client-side against the nine known feed toggles, with a clear error.

### Added

- **Offline test suite** (`tests/`, pytest) — runs with no network, wired
  into CI as a gate before build/publish. Covers **every registered command**
  (parametrized registration + binding checks: each command exposes a typed
  `args=` schema and every declared flag is accepted by its arg-binding),
  plus per-command parser, request-body, and schema-contract tests. Together
  they lock both bug classes shut: "command rejects its own declared flag"
  and "documented-but-wrong field name."

## [1.22.5] – 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- **MCP commands rejecting their own `--flag` args.** Any command declared
  with `@skill_command(args=...)` but no custom `parser=` raised
  `Command '<name>' does not accept flags` when driven over MCP (the
  MCP→CLI bridge serializes every kwarg as `--flag value`). Added an
  auto-parser fallback in the dispatcher that routes declared kebab-case
  flags to the wrapper's snake_case kwargs with type coercion — fixes
  `profile-match`, `trip-discovery`, `event-agenda`, `event-free-slots`,
  `session-bookmark`, `meetup-rsvp`, `room-messages`, `room-summaries`,
  and makes "declared in `args=` ⇒ accepted on the CLI" a structural
  invariant.
- **`event-schedule` / `event-meetups` help corrected.** Both wrongly
  claimed "Requires an event ticket". The listings are public — only
  RSVPing to a meetup needs a ticket.

### Changed

- **Version-locked to API 1.22.5.** Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to match the
  deployed release: `GET /tickets` now defaults to the tickets you hold
  (`valid` + `maybe`) and never exposes canceled tickets, and the locator
  `serializeProfile` path respects the `shareLoc` location opt-out.

## [1.22.4] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Trip points CLI drift.** `dc trip-create` and `dc trip-update` now
  actually parse and forward `--points` as a JSON array. The commands had
  advertised the flag, but the custom parser was dropping it before the API
  call.
- **Member API parity fixes are now version-locked.** Bumped
  `DC_API_VERSION` from `1.22.3` to `1.22.4` to match the deployed API
  release that queues profile/calendar sync side effects, makes event
  bookmark/meetup mutations transactional and idempotent, accepts `noteHTML`
  on trip points, and returns the standard membership role key `dcc`.

### Changed

- Trip point docs now include the full supported shape:
  `{note?, noteHTML?, placeID?}`.

## [1.22.3] – 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Search — 6 new commands** wrapping the new `/search/*` endpoint family.
  `dc.search(q, page=1, per_page=20)` runs a multi-resource search across
  profiles, rooms, messages, events, and chapters in one call. Per-resource
  commands (`dc.search_profiles`, `dc.search_rooms`, `dc.search_messages`,
  `dc.search_events`, `dc.search_chapters`) accept the same `q` + pagination
  arguments plus resource-specific filters: `--room-id` + `--user-id` on
  messages; `--type` on rooms; `--city-id` / `--country` / `--since` /
  `--until` on events. 1-indexed pagination via `page` / `per_page`; the
  response envelope is `{ hits, total, page, hasMore }`. Only the caller's
  own visible surface is returned — server-side post-filter drops anything
  the caller can't see, and per-resource serializers whitelist fields.
- **Follows — 6 new commands.** `dc.follows_profiles()` / `dc.follows_chapters()`
  return the caller's full follow lists (caps: **150 profiles**, **50
  chapters**). `dc.follow_profile(userID)` / `dc.follow_chapter(cityID)`
  add to the list (`409 follow_limit_reached` when the cap is hit, `400
  self_follow_not_allowed` on self-follow attempts, `404 profile_not_found`
  for hidden / non-existent users). `dc.unfollow_profile(userID)` /
  `dc.unfollow_chapter(cityID)` remove. All mutations are protected by
  `sensitiveBurstGuard`. The follow list is private to the caller — there
  is no inbound-follower lookup, no follower-count exposure on profiles.

### Changed

- `DC_API_VERSION` bumped from `1.20.1` → `1.22.3` to match the deployed
  server. Server bumps for search + follows shipped as `1.22.0`, then
  re-deployed as `1.22.3` after an in-band fix to the OpenAPI generator
  (missing route-file imports were causing the new endpoints to be absent
  from the published spec).

---

## [1.20.1] – 2026-05-22

### Added

- **`warning` field on the response envelope.** Both success (`ok: true`)
  and error (`ok: false`) payloads now carry an optional top-level
  `warning` string. Currently used by the server to surface client-version
  drift notices ("dc-py 1.10.0 is 10 minor versions behind the deployed
  API…") on every call from an outdated client, alongside the existing
  HTTP `Warning: 299 …` response header. No client-side parsing change
  required — clients that ignore the field stay unaffected.

### Changed

- **Hard rename `direct` → `dm` in the room-type vocabulary.** The
  member-facing room-type values are now `channel`, `dm`, `group`,
  `discussion`, `quick-question`, `event`. Calls to
  `GET /rooms/inbox/direct` now return `400 invalid_type` instead of
  redirecting — there is **no alias**. Update any pinned `?type=direct`
  filters to `?type=dm`. Internal `RoomType.Direct` is unchanged; this
  is a pure wire-format rename.
- **`/profile/limits` 308 redirect removed.** The endpoint moved to
  `/limits` in 1.11.0; the redirect existed for old clients. Now it
  returns `404 not_found` with a hint:
  *Did you mean `GET /limits`?* — `dc-py` has been on `/limits` for
  several releases so no callable change for current clients.
- **Smarter 404 "Did you mean…?" suggester.** Adds a suffix-match
  bonus so `/profile/limits` resolves to `/limits` (previously
  Levenshtein-only would have suggested `/profile-match`). Same for any
  `/v2/X/Y` → `/X/Y` style leftover-prefix mistakes.

### Notes

- The deployed server is **`1.20.1`** (deploy script auto-patched the
  manually-bumped `1.20.0`). The triple-lock is therefore kept at
  `1.20.1` here so the X-API-Version warning stays silent for
  up-to-date clients.

---

## [1.19.3] – 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Server-side: did-you-mean 404 suggester is now functional on
  Express 5.** The previous implementation walked the internal Express
  router stack to recover all `METHOD path` pairs at startup, but
  Express 5 nulled `layer.regexp` on mounted sub-routers (the mount
  prefix moved into a `path-to-regexp` closure on `layer.matchers[0]`)
  and renamed `app._router` → `app.router`. Result: the route table
  was empty in production and every 404 fell through to the generic
  hint. Switched the source-of-truth from the router stack to the
  docs `endpointRegistry` (every documented endpoint already calls
  `registerEndpoint(...)`), plus a small static list of unlisted
  discovery endpoints (`/`, `/ping`, `/health`, `/openapi.json`,
  `/workflows`, `/security.txt`).

  No client-side change required — the `hint` field on 404 payloads
  is already surfaced by `DCError`. Bump kept in lockstep with the
  deployed server version per the triple-lock rule.

---

## [1.19.2] – 2026-05-21

### Added

- **`workflows` command** — calls the new `GET /workflows` endpoint and
  returns a machine-readable list of common API recipes
  (who-is-in-city, plan-together-at-event, find-DCers-by-description,
  manage-inbox, refresh-profile, catch-up-on-channel, etc.). Each
  recipe carries a goal, an ordered list of `{method, path}` steps,
  and notes. Designed as the first call an unfamiliar agent makes to
  the API.
- **Error responses now carry an optional `hint` field** on the server
  side. The client surfaces it via `DCError` automatically — when the
  server includes a hint pointing at a discovery endpoint or follow-up
  call, it shows up in the exception. No client-side API changes; the
  field is additive on the wire.

### Changed

- **404s on unknown paths now include a "Did you mean…?" suggestion**
  (server side). The Levenshtein-based suggester compares the requested
  path against the live route table — typos like `/place/<id>` get a
  hint pointing at `/places/<id>`. Surfaces in the `hint` field of the
  404 payload.

(Versions 1.18.0 → 1.19.1 were server-side only; this is the first
public client release on the new line.)

---

## [1.17.3] – 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Big docs audit + cleanup — 25 endpoint description issues fixed.**
  An exhaustive audit of every `registerEndpoint(...)` description
  against the actual handler code surfaced lies, drift, and gaps that
  were misleading LLM agents. All landed in one patch:

  **Response-shape lies (8 critical):**
  - `POST /virtual-events/:sessionID/rsvp` — actual response is
    `{ sessionID, status, userID }`, not `{ status, joinCall, rsvpAt }`.
    Docs claimed RSVPing "unlocks the join URL" — it doesn't; `meetUrl`
    is exposed regardless of RSVP state.
  - `GET /virtual-events/:sessionID` — dropped false claims about
    `host`, IANA `timezone`, `recording URL`, and RSVP-gated join URL.
  - `PATCH /calendar` — returns `{ updated: true }` only, not toggles
    plus feed URLs.
  - `GET /inbox/unread` — `limit` is 1-100, not 1-200.
  - `GET /invites` — `status` enum was missing four real values
    (`booked-call`, `awaiting-payment-auth`, `invalid`, `qualified`).
  - `GET /profile` — removed false "DC BLACK members see additional
    business fields" claim (tier-blind since 1.16.2).
  - `POST /trips` — per-field text clarified to "pass exactly one of
    `placeID` or `eventID`" (was "required if the other not provided",
    which implied both could be passed).

  **Pagination metadata gaps (6 list endpoints):**
  - `/chapters`, `/events`, `/trips`, `/tickets`, `/invites`,
    `/virtual-events` — schemas and handlers already supported
    `cursor` + `nextCursor`. Now documented.

  **Other misleading text (5):**
  - `/profile-match` — `gender` enum gains `Prefer not to say`;
    `minTeamSize` notes that the same value exists in the bucket
    vocabulary but is treated as unknown and filtered out.
  - `/notifications` — fixed stale reference to non-existent
    `/profile/locator-settings` (correct path is `/locator/settings`).
  - `POST /invites` — documented actual response shape (nested
    under `referral`, `referralID` not `inviteID`).
  - `/events/:eventID/agendas` + `/free-slots` — `userIDs` marked
    required.

  **Thin response shapes + access notes (6):**
  - `/events/:eventID/attendees` — full profile shape clarified;
    `limit` corrected to 1-100.
  - `/chapters/:cityID` — full chapter + `currentVisitors` shapes
    spelled out.
  - `/places/:placeID` — full place shape spelled out.
  - `/events/:eventID/{schedule,agenda,meetups,sponsors,
    schedule/:sessionID/attendees,meetups/:meetupID/attendees}` —
    added explicit "Access: caller must hold a valid ticket" note.

No behavior change — pure docs/metadata patch. PyPI tag bump keeps
`DC_API_VERSION` aligned with the deployed server.

## [1.17.2] – 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Docs cleanup** — four endpoints had near-empty descriptions that
  rendered as placeholder cards in the public Scalar docs. Fleshed
  out so LLM agents and members reading the docs have enough context
  to choose the right endpoint:
  - `DELETE /trips/:tripID` — calls out owner-only, irreversible,
    side-effects (linked chat room destroyed, chapter rollups
    recomputed).
  - `GET /virtual-events/:sessionID` — full payload + RSVP state.
  - `POST /virtual-events/:sessionID/rsvp` — three statuses,
    idempotency, what each does.
  - `GET /invites` — documents the three credit sources (`manual`,
    `permaCode`, `mention`). `mention` noted as a one-line fallback
    (applicant named you on their application form) and explicitly
    framed as not reliable — don't count on it.

No client-facing behavior change — pure documentation patch. PyPI
client tag bumps to keep `DC_API_VERSION` aligned with the deployed
server so the `X-API-Version` warning stays accurate.

## [1.17.1] – 2026-05-20

### Breaking

- **`activity` room-type renamed to `quick-question` on the API wire.**
  The official in-app label has been "Quick Question" for a while —
  the API surface now matches. URLs (`/rooms/inbox/quick-question`,
  `/rooms/browse/quick-question`) and response shapes (`type:
  "quick-question"`) use the new identifier. Old `activity` paths and
  type filters now return 400. The internal Firestore tag stays
  `activity` — this is a wire-format rename only.

### Added

- **AI summaries — daily and weekly slots, history pagination.**
  - `GET /rooms/:roomID` now returns BOTH `aiSummaryDaily` and
    `aiSummaryWeekly` in distinct slots (either may be `null`). They
    cover different windows so they never get blended.
  - **`dc room-summary <roomID> --type daily|weekly`** — fetch the
    latest single summary of a specific type. Type is required; the
    type-agnostic call was deliberately removed.
  - **`dc room-summaries <roomID> --type daily|weekly [--limit N]
    [--cursor TOKEN]`** — paginate past summaries newest-first.
    Cursor encodes `sortDateAt`. Useful for catch-up workflows.
  - Each summary carries: `type`, `summaryID`, sanitized `html`,
    `topics[]`, `urls[]` with `{label, url, sharedBy}`,
    `intervalStartAt`, `intervalEndAt`, `generatedAt`,
    `messageCount`, `participantCount`.
- **Room state management (writes the per-user `seen` doc).**
  - **`dc room-subscribe <roomID>`** — subscribe to a public
    channel, discussion, quick-question room, or event room. Event
    rooms require a valid ticket. DMs and group DMs are managed
    in-app only.
  - **`dc room-unsubscribe <roomID>`** — drop a room from your inbox
    sidebar. Clears the room's badge count to avoid the
    stuck-red-dot bug.
  - **`dc room-mute <roomID>` / `dc room-unmute <roomID>`** — mute is
    indefinite (until you explicitly unmute); the room stays in your
    inbox.
  - **`dc room-archive <roomID>` / `dc room-unarchive <roomID>`** —
    archive hides the room from your inbox sidebar without
    unsubscribing.
  - **`dc room-pin <roomID>` / `dc room-unpin <roomID>`** — pin to
    top of inbox. Pinning a subscription-type room auto-subscribes
    you if you weren't already (mirrors the in-app behavior).

All mutation endpoints mirror the in-app `useSeenService` exactly —
same transaction semantics, same audit timestamps (`subscribedAt`,
`unsubscribedAt`, `archivedAt`, `unarchivedAt`, `pinnedAt`,
`mutedUntilAt`), same auto-subscribe-on-pin behavior. They're also
wired into the new `sensitiveBurstGuard` rate-limit layer so leaked
API keys can't be used to abuse the mutation surface.

## [1.16.2] – 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Public "other-person" profile now matches the in-app profile card.**
  Every DC tier (DC + DC BLACK alike) now sees the same field set on
  `/profile-match` results, `/events/:eventID/attendees`,
  `/chapters/:cityID/members`, `/chapters/:cityID/currentVisitors`,
  `/trips/:tripID/discovery`, and every other endpoint that returns
  someone else's profile.

  Newly visible fields (were DC-BLACK-only or omitted entirely):
  `bizName`, `bizUrl`, `bizDescription`, `bizYears`, `bizIndustry`,
  `goal`, `expertise`, `ama`, `hobbies`, `nickname`, `locations`,
  `connect`, `revenue`, `teamSize`, and a new `socials` block with
  `facebook`, `focusmate`, `github`, `instagram`, `linkedin`,
  `twitter`.

  Privacy-gated fields (`revenue`, `teamSize`, `connect`) only
  populate when the field owner shared the value with all DCers;
  otherwise `null`.

  **Not exposed on the other-person view:** `whatsapp`. WhatsApp stays
  on the member's own `/profile` only — members have not consented
  to expose it to API consumers.

  **DCB-specific shape removed.** A single `ApiProfile` shape is now
  returned everywhere — DC and DC BLACK callers get the same surface.

### Added

- **Member API now open to trial DC accounts.** Trial members are
  eligible from day one (was: blocked until trial period ended).
  Auto-generated API keys land on first profile sync. Guests and
  inactive accounts remain blocked.

## [1.14.1] – 2026-05-19

### Added

- **`dc room <roomID>`** — single-room metadata read (name, type,
  description, stats, last activity, scope). Access gate is strict:
  the caller must be a subscribed member of the room, or the room must
  be a publicly browsable channel/discussion/activity. Non-members of
  private rooms, DMs, group DMs, and event rooms get a clear 403.
- **`dc room-messages <roomID>`** — paginated, **read-only** message
  history for any room the caller has access to. Newest-first; cursor
  via `--before=<token>`. Limit 1–100 (default 50). Each entry has
  `messageID`, `roomID`, `sentAt`, `editedAt`, `isDeleted`, mini
  `author` block (userID, userName, displayName, photo, profileURL),
  `text` (possibly sanitized HTML), `type`, `isHTML`, `replyTo`,
  `reactions`. Sunk and hidden messages are filtered server-side;
  deleted messages render as tombstones with empty text. Reading does
  NOT mutate the room's unread state on the caller's profile —
  agents can scan history without marking messages as read.
- **`GET /chapters/:cityID` returns `currentVisitors`** — every DCer
  currently in that chapter's city via an active trip
  (`startDate <= now <= endDate`). Each entry includes the visitor's
  mini profile, trip ID, and trip start/end dates. Hidden + guest
  profiles are filtered. Answers "who is in <city> right now?"
  without forcing the caller to create their own trip first.

### Changed

- **`dc rooms` is now path-segment filtered.** The optional
  `--type` flag still works on the client side, but the underlying
  URL changed from `/rooms?type=X` to `/rooms/inbox/:type` (e.g.
  `/rooms/inbox/direct`). The all-types call stays at `/rooms` (no
  filter). Cursor pagination via `--cursor=<token>` is now supported.
- **`dc browse-rooms` switched to `/rooms/browse/:type`.** Existing
  callers (the dc-py 1.13.x release) pointed at `/rooms/browse?type=`
  — this client now uses the new path. Cursor pagination unchanged.
- **`dc rooms --type=` enum trimmed** to `channel`, `direct`, `group`,
  `discussion`, `activity`, `event`. Legacy `city` / `country` /
  `mastermind` types are no longer filterable via this endpoint (the
  app still classifies them internally; they just don't appear on the
  public Member-API filter surface).
- **`/profile-match locationCurrentPlaceID` docs** now flag that this
  filter is sparsely populated (most DCers leave `currentLocation`
  null) and point at the trip-discovery flow as the canonical
  presence query.
- **Public role-label examples** drop the legacy `"DC Red"` string —
  responses now show the canonical `"DC Member"` / `"DC Community"`
  labels per the brand convention.

## [1.13.1] – 2026-05-19

### Added

- **`dc trip <tripID>`** — single-trip read with the full payload.
  Returns trip basics (`location`, `dates`, `note`, `roomID`) plus the
  embedded `points` (up to 20 venue/idea notes with optional Google
  Place data) AND a fully-enriched `discovery` block:
  - `discovery.people` — ranked top-10 DCers to meet, each with mini
    `profile` (userID, userName, displayName, photo, headline), a
    `score` (higher = better match), `reason` (`local` / `visiting` /
    `event-attendee`), `overlapDays`, `detail`.
  - `discovery.fullPool` — every visible DCer travelling or local
    during the trip window. Same shape as `people` minus `score`.
  - `discovery.whyToMeet` — AI-written "why you should meet them"
    paragraphs keyed by userID, each `{ text, generatedAt }`. Only
    the top-10 picks get entries. Persistent across refreshes.
  - `discovery.events` — events in the destination city during the
    trip window.
  - `discovery.overlappingTrips` — other DCers travelling at the
    same time/place, with mini `profile` attached (no second fetch
    needed).
  - `discovery.generatedAt` — when the discovery cache was last
    refreshed.
  Hidden + guest profiles are filtered out from all discovery lists.
  The `discovery` block is `null` for newly-created trips until the
  background sync task runs (typically seconds).

- **`dc trip-discovery <tripID> [--include=...]`** — discovery-only
  read. Same shape as the `discovery` block in the full trip read,
  without the trip body. Useful when an agent just needs the
  matchmaking signal.
  - `--include` accepts a comma-separated subset of
    `people,fullPool,whyToMeet,events,overlappingTrips`. Default = all
    five. Common patterns:
    - `--include=people,whyToMeet` — top-10 picks + their AI paragraphs
    - `--include=fullPool` — every visible DCer in town
    - `--include=events` — just events in the destination city

- **`dc trip-refresh <tripID>`** — owner-only trigger to re-enqueue
  the discovery cache rebuild. Returns 202 immediately; cache
  refreshes in the background.

- **Trip points on `trip-create` / `trip-update`** — both commands now
  accept an optional `--points` array (up to 20). Each item is
  `{note: string (max 280 chars), placeID?: string}`. The optional
  `placeID` is resolved against Google Places at write time and the
  full Place object (city, country, lat/lon, name, etc.) is stored
  on the trip — so reads don't do any lookups. Notes without a
  `placeID` are valid ("remember to book a coworking space"). On
  `trip-update`, passing `--points` **replaces** the entire array;
  pass `[]` to clear.

### Why

The DC web/mobile app now exposes trip "points" and a rich AI
discovery surface in the trip detail page — places to remember,
"who should I meet on this trip?" with ranked picks, AI-written
intros explaining why each pick matters, and overlapping trips with
attached profiles. This release brings all of that through the Member
API so AI agents can plan trips, pre-brief a member before they
travel, and find shared meeting windows without fanning out a dozen
separate calls.

### Fixed

- **MCP stdio transport hang.** Replaced the Python SDK `stdio_server`
  helper with a small buffered stdio transport so `dc.py --mcp`
  responds reliably to `initialize`, `tools/list`, and tool calls on
  current Python/MCP SDK setups.

---

## [1.12.5] – 2026-05-14

### Added

- **`POST /profile-match` — real similarity scores + new filters + reranker A/B.**
  - Each result now carries three scores: `score` (composite, sortable —
    blend of vector + keyword when reranker ran, raw `vectorScore`
    otherwise), `vectorScore` (pure semantic 0..1 from Firestore
    vector search), and `keywordScore` (raw keyword overlap, only when
    reranker ran). Old "fake" rank-derived scores are gone — these are
    the real numbers and reflect actual match quality.
  - Four new filters compose with AND alongside the existing ones:
    - `industry` — exact match on PrimaryBusinessIndustry
      (`"SaaS & Tech"`, `"Marketing Agency"`, `"Ecommerce & Amazon"`,
      `"Coaching"`, `"Other"`, etc.).
    - `min_team_size` — "at least this size" filter, ordered
      `None < 1-2 < 3-5 < 6-9 < 10-14 < 15-19 < 20-34 < 35-49 < 50-74 < 75-99 < 100+`.
      Only matches DCers who set their team-size visibility to "all DCers".
    - `min_revenue` — "at least this revenue" filter (e.g. `"$1M+"`,
      `"$250K+"`). Only matches DCers who set their revenue visibility
      to "all DCers".
    - `gender` — exact match (`Man`, `Woman`, `Non-binary`). **Note:
      Gender is sparsely populated — most DCers leave it blank.**
      Use as a "narrow if set" hint, not a hard requirement.
  - `no_rerank` flag skips the keyword reranker and returns results
    in raw vector-similarity order. Useful for fuzzy/semantic queries
    where exact keyword overlap would add noise, or for A/B comparison
    against the reranked default.
  - Result limit cap raised 20 → 50 (default still 20 in the skill).

- **`GET /` is fully self-describing.** Returns `{ name, version, links }`
  with `links` pointing at `/openapi.json`, `/.well-known/mcp.json`,
  `/.well-known/security.txt`, the docs page, plus marketing URLs
  (`site`, `apply`, `dcBlack`). One fetch tells any agent where to go.
- **`GET /openapi.json`** + **`GET /.well-known/openapi.json`** serve the
  full OpenAPI 3.1 spec. IANA-registered well-known location plus the
  canonical short path.
- **`GET /.well-known/mcp.json`** — Anthropic MCP discovery descriptor
  (name, transport, install command, auth scheme, openapi pointer).
- **`GET /.well-known/security.txt`** — RFC 9116 security contact.

### Fixed
- **Rerank math sign-flip.** The keyword reranker was sorting on raw
  euclidean distance (lower = closer) with the same direction as
  similarity (higher = better) — so ties surfaced the FURTHEST
  candidates, not the closest. Now: distance → similarity via
  `1 / (1 + d)` before reranking, and the keyword score is normalised
  per batch so it doesn't swamp the vector signal.
- **Mode-2 ("DCers you should meet") reranking.** When no `query` is
  passed and the server builds an implicit query from your profile,
  the reranker is now applied (previously skipped because metadata
  was passed as an array).
- **Locator privacy gate.** `GET /locator/digest` now filters hidden
  test accounts and guest profiles out of `homeCity.newMembers`,
  `chapterLeads`, `localMembers`, and every trip/ticket reference.

### Changed
- `profile.locCurrent` type acknowledges that it can carry a `placeID`
  (it's a `Place` when derived from `locMobile` / `locBase` / active
  trip, a bare `Loc` otherwise). No data change; the schema type just
  matches the docs that have always existed in production.

---

## [1.12.1] – 2026-05-08

### Added
- **`GET /events/:eventID/agendas?userIDs=A,B,C`** — bulk fetch up
  to 20 attendee agendas in one call. Drop-in for the LLM use-case
  "compare schedules across several DCers" (find shared sessions,
  spot meetup overlap) without paying N round-trips. Non-attendee
  IDs are silently dropped — pass a candidate list without
  pre-checking each ticket. Caller must hold a valid ticket to the
  event. New skill command: `dc event-agendas <eventID>
  --user-ids=A,B,C`.
- **`POST /events/:eventID/free-slots`** — server-side computation
  of shared free time windows across event attendees. Body:
  `{ userIDs[], minDurationMins?, withinDayDate? }`. Returns slots
  ranked by overlap (most-shared first), each tagged with `freeFor`
  / `busyFor`. Date math runs server-side once instead of in every
  LLM caller — the same fake-UTC wall-clock convention as the rest
  of the events API, paired with the venue IANA timezone. Caller
  must hold a valid ticket; non-attendee IDs silently dropped. New
  skill command: `dc event-free-slots <eventID> --user-ids=A,B,C
  [--min-duration-mins=30] [--within-day-date=2026-05-06]`.

### Why
- Single-attendee `/agenda/:userID` shipped in 1.10.5; the missing
  pieces for "plan together with N DCers at an event" were the
  bulk fetch and the gap-finder. Both now land together so the
  AI-agent UX for "find me 30 minutes with Peter on Tuesday" or
  "plan a junto-style lunch with Alex, Lina, and Jeff at DCMEX"
  works in one or two calls.

---

## [1.11.1] – 2026-05-07

### Breaking
- **`/profile/limits` moved to `/limits`.** The rate-limit
  endpoint is now mounted at the root, like the rest of the
  non-profile surface. The old path returns **HTTP 308** with
  `Location: /limits` — 308 preserves the GET method (vs 301
  which clients sometimes downgrade), so older callers that
  follow redirects keep working through one extra hop. The
  `dc.limits()` helper in this client already points at the
  new path.

### Changed
- **`POST /profile-match` is now described as "AI-powered".**
  Behaviour unchanged. The public OpenAPI description now
  leads with "AI-powered profile matchmaker" so callers
  immediately understand it uses Gemini embeddings + reranking
  under the hood, and carries stricter rate limits than the
  standard CRUD endpoints.

---

## [1.10.5] – 2026-05-07

### Added
- **`POST /profile-match`** — match DCers from a free-form
  description, or recommend if no `query` is passed. Profiles-only.
  Optional filters compose with AND:
   - `query` — free-form description ("DCers in Lisbon who run SaaS")
   - `locationChapterPlaceID` — narrow to DCers based at this Google Place
   - `locationCurrentPlaceID` — narrow to DCers currently at this place
   - `eventID` — narrow to DCers attending the event (valid ticket only)
   - `isDCB` — DC BLACK members only
  Hard cap at `limit: 20`. Each result includes `chapter` (base) +
  `currentLocation` (when travelling).
- **`GET /events/:eventID/agenda/:userID`** — view another attendee's
  agenda for a shared event so AI agents can plan together (find
  coffee windows, suggest sessions to overlap, propose meetups).
  Both you and the target must hold a valid ticket. Returns the same
  shape as the self `/agenda` plus the target's mini profile.
- **`currentLocation` field on every `ApiProfile` response** — built
  from a member's current location, populated only when different
  from their base chapter.
- **New CLI commands**: `dc profile-match [--query …] [--limit N] [--location-chapter-place-id …] [--location-current-place-id …] [--event-id …] [--is-dcb]` and `dc event-agenda <eventID> [--user-id …]`.
- **New library methods**: `DC.profile_match(...)` and `DC.event_agenda(event_id, user_id=None)`.

### Changed
- **List/recommendation endpoints now exclude system-test profiles
  and event-only guest profiles.** New shared `isPubliclyVisible`
  gate applied to: `/profile-match`, `/events/:eventID/attendees`,
  session/meetup attendees, `/chapters/:cityID` members,
  `/trips/overlaps`. Single-profile lookups are unaffected.

Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to 1.10.5 (matches deployed server).

---

## [1.10.4] – 2026-05-04

### Fixed
- **`PATCH /notifications` now actually persists changes.** Previous
  release set values via `set({"cats.foo.email": false}, {merge:true})`
  which Firestore stores as a literal top-level key — silently no-op
  for the read path. Now uses `update()` (which understands dot paths)
  with a fall-through to `set(nested)` for first-time writes.

### Changed
- API instance class bumped from F1 (256MB / 384MB hard cap) to F2
  (512MB) so the server starts cleanly. The expanded surface (sharp,
  stripe, full route set) was OOM'ing F1 at startup.

Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to 1.10.4 (matches deployed server).

---

## [1.10.2] – 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`GET /membership/invoices`** — your Stripe invoices (newest first)
  with hosted invoice URL + PDF link, amount, currency, status, period
  start/end, and plan description. Useful for self-serve receipts.
  Returns an empty list for legacy paypal/chargify members or members
  with no Stripe customer record.
- **`GET /notifications` + `PATCH /notifications`** — read and update
  push/email preferences per notification category. 12 categories:
  `account`, `activity`, `announcement`, `channel`, `chat`,
  `directMessage`, `discussion`, `event`, `mention`, `myReaction`,
  `photoTag`, `reaction`. Email is `null` for `reaction` / `myReaction`
  (not supported there). Defaults are applied for any preference you
  haven't explicitly set.
- **`GET /locator/settings` + `PATCH /locator/settings`** — read and
  update the four toggles for the Friday locator email digest:
  `enabled`, `events`, `tickets`, `trips`.
- **`GET /calendar` + `PATCH /calendar`** — your iCalendar feed and
  the 9 content toggles. Returns three subscription URLs for the same
  feed: `httpsURL` (works in any calendar app), `webcalURL` (macOS /
  iOS open it directly), and `googleURL` (one-click Google Calendar
  subscribe). Toggles control which event categories are included:
  your tickets, bookmarked agenda items, virtual calls, your trips,
  flagship events (DCBKK/DCMEX), DC BLACK retreats, home chapter
  events, followed-chapter events, and other-chapter events. Defaults
  mirror the in-app subscribe modal exactly.
- **New CLI commands**: `dc invoices`, `dc notifications`,
  `dc notifications-update`, `dc locator-settings`,
  `dc locator-settings-update`, `dc calendar`, `dc calendar-update`.
- **New library methods**: `DC.membership_invoices()`,
  `DC.notifications()`, `DC.update_notifications()`,
  `DC.locator_settings()`, `DC.update_locator_settings()`,
  `DC.calendar()`, `DC.update_calendar()`.

### Fixed
- Sharp re-encode pipeline for `POST /report-issue` screenshots no
  longer rejects valid PNG/JPEG/WebP images on the right `fit` option.
  EXIF metadata still stripped on every accepted upload.

Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to 1.10.2 (matches deployed server).

---

## [1.9.1] – 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`GET /membership`** — your full membership state in one call:
  role (label + key), join date, DC BLACK status, trial info, full
  billing details (status, plan, current period, next billing date,
  formatted amount, currency, frequency), and a Stripe Customer Portal
  link for managing your subscription, payment method, and invoices.
  Use this to check renewal dates, see your current tier, or surface
  the manage-billing link in your own UI.
- **`POST /report-issue`** — self-service bug / feedback / question
  reporting endpoint. Sends a structured report to the DC team with
  your message, optional structured `context` for debug info, and an
  optional screenshot. The Python client's `report_issue(...)` helper
  accepts a screenshot as a file path, raw bytes, or a base64 / data:
  URL string and handles encoding for you. PNG, JPEG, or WebP only;
  re-encoded server-side to strip EXIF; max 4 MB raw.
  **Privacy note:** screenshots and report text go to the DC team
  unredacted — don't include passwords, payment details, or secrets.
- **New CLI commands**: `dc membership` and `dc report-issue --text "..." [--severity bug|feedback|question] [--screenshot path] [--context '{...}']`.
- **New library methods**: `DC.membership()` and `DC.report_issue(text, severity, screenshot, context)`.

Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to 1.9.1 (matches deployed server).

---

## [1.8.1] – 2026-05-04

### Added
- **`type` field on every `/places/search` and `/places/:placeID`
  result** — `"city"` for chapter-level matches usable in `POST
  /trips`; `"venue"` for everything else (specific addresses,
  establishments, country-level matches). Filter `type === "city"`
  in your client code when building a trip-creation flow; events
  and meetups accept both.
- **Richer location fields on every place + trip response**:
  `description`, `lat`, `lon`, `latLon`, `region`, `regionCode`,
  `utcOffsetMins`. Available on `/places/search`, `/places/:placeID`,
  and trip responses.

### Fixed
- **Trips created via API now sync correctly with the DC web app.**
  Previously, opening an API-created trip in the in-app trip editor
  could show a "Location is invalid" error and block Save. Resolved.
- **`/places/search` no longer returns country-level matches with
  empty city fields.** Useless results that could lead to broken
  trips are now properly classified as `type: "venue"` instead.
- **Chapter counts and locator digests update immediately after a
  trip create / update / delete via the API**, instead of waiting
  for the next periodic recalc.

### Changed
- **`POST /trips` rejects placeIDs that aren't cities.** Passing a
  venue placeID now returns 400 with a clear error pointing you at
  `/places/search` and the `type === "city"` filter.

Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to 1.8.1 (matches deployed server).

---

## [1.7.1] – 2026-05-03

### Changed
- **Profile `chapter` field is now populated.** Previously the API
  always returned `chapter: null` regardless of whether the member
  had set a base location. Now `dc.profile()` returns the member's
  home chapter as `{chapterURL, cityName, country, countryCode, placeID}`
  whenever they've set `locBase` in their DC profile.
- **Chapter shape unified across endpoints.** `/chapters` list/detail
  now matches the profile.chapter shape exactly: `cityName` (was
  `city`), plus `country` (added) alongside `countryCode`, plus
  `chapterURL` and `placeID`. `/locator/digest` `favoriteCities`
  entries also now include `country` (full name) alongside
  `countryCode`.
- `cityName` uses the same friendly-display logic as the in-app
  profile card ("Bangkok, Thailand" rather than just "Bangkok").

### Fixed
- `/chapters` `chapterURL` was pointing at `cdn.dynamitecircle.com`
  (the CDN, no app routes there). Now points at
  `dc.dynamitecircle.com/chapter/<placeID>`.

Bumped `DC_API_VERSION` to 1.7.1 (matches deployed server).

---

## [1.6.3] – 2026-05-02

Same content as the failed 1.6.2 attempt — PyPI never accepted 1.6.2
because the GitHub Actions smoke step asserted that `dc --json help`
emits JSON, which it never has (`help` is text-only). Smoke step
rewritten to use `dc help setup` (which exercises subcommand-help
dispatch without any network call). Bumping to 1.6.3 because PyPI
versions are immutable — we can't retry 1.6.2.

## [1.6.2] – 2026-05-02 (skipped — workflow failed)

Tag exists but no PyPI release. Replaced by 1.6.3.

### Changed

- **Repo renamed** — `dynamitecircle/dc-py` → `dynamitecircle/dc`. The
  repo is now a **monorepo** so future Go / Node / Rust clients can sit
  alongside the Python one without a separate repo per language.
- **Python client moved to `/py/`** — `/dc/dc.py` → `/py/dc.py`,
  `/dc/SKILL.md` → `/py/SKILL.md`, etc. The `.claude/skills/dc` and
  `.agents/skills/dc` symlinks now point at `../../py` so AI-tool
  auto-discovery is unchanged. (Future siblings will live at `/go/`,
  `/node/`, `/rs/`.)
- **Layout** — canonical files moved out of dotfile-prefixed directories
  so they're visible in `ls`. Python client is at `/py/` and the
  design docs are `/docs/`. `.claude/skills/dc/`, `.agents/skills/dc/`,
  `.claude/docs/`, and `.agents/docs/` are now symlinks pointing at the
  canonical folders. AI-tool auto-discovery still works through the
  symlinks; you only edit files in one place.
- **File rename** — `dc/dc_skill.py` → `dc/dc.py` (later moved to
  `py/dc.py` in the monorepo flip; the `_skill` suffix was redundant
  once the folder itself is the skill).
- **Class renames** — public Python surface refreshed:
  - `DCSkill` → `DC`
  - `Skill` (base) → `Runtime`
  - `SkillError` → `DCError`
  - `SkillResult` → `Result`
  - Old: `from dc_skill import DCSkill; DCSkill().profile()`
  - New: `from dc import DC; DC().profile()`
- **Doc renames** for symmetry inside `docs/`:
  - `docs/skill-conventions.md` → `docs/skill-info.md`
  - `docs/mcp.md` → `docs/mcp-info.md`
- **User-Agent** — `dc-official-skill/<version>` →
  `dc-py/<version>`. Reserves a clean naming pattern for future ports
  (`dc-go`, `dc-node`, `dc-rs`).

### Added

- **PyPI packaging** — `pyproject.toml` at repo root (hatchling backend)
  builds the `dynamitecircle` package from `py/dc.py`. The single file
  ships in the wheel as `dynamitecircle.py`, so installs give users
  `from dynamitecircle import DC` and a `dc` console script on PATH.
  Optional `[mcp]` extra installs the MCP server dependency. Version is
  read at build time from `DC_API_VERSION` so it stays in lockstep with
  the repo's existing version constant.
- **`main()` entry point** in `py/dc.py` — extracted from the
  `if __name__ == "__main__"` block so the `dc` console script
  (`pip install dynamitecircle` → `dc help`) can target it directly.
- **GitHub Actions publish workflow** at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
  — builds wheel + sdist on every push, smoke-tests installs across
  Python 3.9 + 3.12 on Ubuntu / macOS / Windows, publishes to PyPI on
  every `v*` tag via OIDC trusted publishing (no API tokens stored),
  then auto-creates a GitHub Release with notes pulled from CHANGELOG.md.
- **README rewrite** — opens with "DC Official Client" + a paragraph
  about what the Dynamite Circle actually is (founded 2011, ~1,500
  founders, $100k+ revenue requirement) with inline links to
  dynamitecircle.com and the apply funnel, both UTM-tagged so we can
  track inbound from this repo. Removes the "multi-language client suite"
  framing — only the Python client exists today.
- **Pre-approval configs** for all three auto-discovery AI tools so users
  don't get per-tool-call approval prompts when they open this repo:
  - Claude Code: `.claude/settings.json` with `mcp__dc__*`,
    `Skill(dc *)`, `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true`
  - Codex CLI: `.codex/config.toml` with
    `default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"`
  - Gemini CLI: `.gemini/settings.json` with `trust: true`
- **`Agent Skill` row** in the README's "How it's exposed" table —
  acknowledges the SKILL.md auto-discovery path that 90% of users will
  actually use, alongside CLI / Python import / MCP server.

### Removed

- **Pin-to-commit guidance** from the README's "Update etiquette"
  section — the API moves fast enough that pinning is anti-recommended.
- **Hardcoded command counts** ("28 commands", "29 commands") replaced
  with "full Member API coverage" + a pointer to `help` for the live
  list. Counts went stale every time we shipped.
- **`dk_<userID>_<random>` format string** replaced with `dk_<api-key>`
  in user-facing docs — members shouldn't have to know the key's
  internal structure.

---

## [1.6.1] – 2026-05-02

### Added

- **`manifest.json`** at the repo root — MCPB schema 0.3
  ([MCP 2025-11 spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/changelog)).
  Carries `display_name`, `long_description`, `author`, `repository`,
  `license`, `capabilities`, `compatibility`, `user_config` blocks.
  Aligns the repo with the `.mcpb` bundle convention so we can ship
  installable bundles later.
- **MIT `LICENSE`** at the repo root. Repo is private today, but the
  license is in place if/when it opens up.
- **`dc/` symlink at the repo root** — shortcut pointing at
  `.claude/skills/dc/` (later inverted in the unreleased layout flip,
  but introduced here).

### Changed

- **`DC_API_VERSION`** bumped to 1.6.1 to match the deployed server API
  release.
- **README's "Three integration modes" → "How it's exposed"** with
  Agent Skill added as the primary integration.
- **Cross-platform** — explicit UTF-8 stdout/stderr reconfigure for
  legacy Windows `cmd.exe`; chmod-on-Windows note in `setup`; README
  "Platform support" section.

---

## [1.6.0] – 2026-04-30

### Added

- **MCP per-command JSON Schemas** — `@skill_command(args={...})` lets
  each command declare typed input schemas (types, required, enums,
  formats, descriptions). MCP clients now see rich autocomplete and
  validation instead of a `additionalProperties: true` fallback.
- **`mcpSchemas` check** in `self-test` — fails if any command is
  missing an `args=` schema, catching coverage drift.
- **Hive-style `emit()`** — ContextVar sink, `Result` wrapper. Commands
  can call `Runtime.emit(...)` (or pass dict/list for auto-JSON
  serialization) to send follow-up text to the calling agent. Surfaces
  to CLI stderr, MCP TextContent, or `result.emitted` for Python.
  JSON envelope `{ok, client, command, result, emitted}` when `--json`
  is set with non-empty emit.
- **Version-mismatch warning** — `DC_API_VERSION` constant. Every request
  sends `User-Agent: dc-py/<version>` and reads the server's
  `X-API-Version` response header. `_VersionTracker` warns once per
  process when the server is on a newer minor/major.

---

## [1.5.0] – 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Announcements** (2 commands):
  - `announcements` — cursor-paginated mixed feed across visible
    broadcast channels (DC, DCBKK, DCMEX, DC BLACK)
  - `announcements-latest` — one most-recent announcement per channel
- **Event extras** — 8 commands gated by an event ticket:
  - `event-schedule` — sessions grouped by day; wall-clock ISO time +
    IANA timezone (NOT real UTC — read both fields together)
  - `event-agenda` — your bookmarked sessions + joined meetups
  - `event-meetups` — approved member-organized meetups
  - `event-sponsors` — sponsors ordered by tier then display order
  - `session-attendees` — who else bookmarked a session
  - `meetup-attendees` — who else RSVP'd to a meetup
  - `session-bookmark` — add/remove a session from your agenda
  - `meetup-rsvp` — join/leave a meetup

---

## [1.3.0] – 2026-04-30

### Added

- **`limits` command** — wraps `/profile/limits`. Returns effective
  per-minute / per-day rate limits and current usage as JSON, so
  scripts get a structured snapshot without parsing `X-RateLimit-*`
  headers manually.
- **HTTP 429 retry** — `HttpClient` auto-retries on rate-limit responses.
  Wait time parsed from `Retry-After` (RFC 7231, preferred), then
  `X-RateLimit-Reset`, then "Try again in N seconds." regex from the
  body, then a 60-second fallback. Configurable via class attributes
  (`max_retries=1`, `max_retry_wait=120`, `fallback_retry_wait=60`).
  Emits a friendly `Rate limited (HTTP 429) — waiting Ns before retry…`
  message to stderr before sleeping; no silent multi-minute hangs.

---

## [1.0.0] – 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Initial scaffold** — `Dynamite-Circle-Builders/dc-official` private
  repo created with the single-file Python client at
  `.claude/skills/dc/dc_skill.py` (later moved to `dc/dc.py`).
- **28 commands** wrapping the public DC Member API — profile,
  trips (CRUD + overlaps), events + RSVP, virtual events + RSVP,
  tickets, invites, inbox, rooms, chapters, places lookup, locator
  digest. Plus `setup` (writes API key to skill-local `.env.dc`) and
  `self-test` (env + network + `/profile` end-to-end).
- **Three integration modes**:
  - CLI (`python3 dc_skill.py <command>`) — stdlib only
  - Python library (`from dc_skill import DCSkill`) — stdlib only
  - MCP server (`dc_skill.py --mcp`) — `pip install mcp` (optional, lazy import)
- **Auto-discovery configs** for Claude Code (`.mcp.json`),
  Codex CLI (`.codex/config.toml`), Gemini CLI (`GEMINI.md` symlink),
  GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), and the
  `.agents/skills/` symlink for Codex skill discovery.
- **Output formats** — text (default, pretty JSON for dicts/lists),
  `--json` (canonical machine-readable), `--python` (eval-safe `repr`).
- **Cursor pagination** envelope `{items, count, cursor, has_more}`
  on every list-returning command. Non-paginated extras (e.g.
  `totalUnread` on `inbox`) pass through under `extra`.
- **Hive-inspired conventions**: two-class pattern (`DC` public wrapper
  + `_DCCore` private helper), `@skill_command(name=, help=, parser=)`
  decorator, space-form CLI flags, ArgHelpers + HttpClient utilities.
- **Cross-platform-safe** — every text-mode file op specifies
  `encoding="utf-8"`, atomic env-file write via `.tmp` + `replace()`,
  chmod 600 on `.env.dc` (no-op on Windows, documented).
- **No telemetry, no usage tracking, no error logging** — public-grade
  design intentionally stripped of internal Hive concerns.
